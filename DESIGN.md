---

**Additions to Frontend:**

- src/components/Games:
  - GameDisplays:
    - HangmanAssets: collection of images to be used for hangman
    - Hangman/HangmanDisplay.tsx: This is the gameplay display for the Hangman game. It includes a keyboard where the player will choose letters and keeps track of/shows which letters have already been guessed correctly/incorrectly. If Player 1 ends game before it’s finished, shows Player 2 a message saying that.
    - Hangman/HangmanLetter.tsx: This contains the functionality to grey out letters on the keyboard that have already been guessed
    - Hangman/HangmanFigure.tsx: This controls the Hangman images to show up on incorrect guesses
    - TTLDisplay.tsx: This is the gameplay display for the TTL Game. It shows the three statements (two truths, one lie) and has radio buttons for each so that the player can choose which one they think is the lie. It displays a message to the player depending on if they guessed correctly or not. If Player 1 ends game before it’s finished, shows Player 2 a message saying that.
  - GameModals:
    - CreateGameModalDialog.tsx: This is the modal that Player 1 will see when they choose to create a new game and when another player joins and they proceed to gameplay. It gives Player 1 the game creation options and prompts them to input the information needed for the game, and then displays a ‘Waiting for Player 2 to join’ message until another player in the town joins the game. Once a player joins, the modal changes to display to show the gameplay. Once the game is over the display switches to show a message saying which player won.
    - BrowseOpenGamesModal.tsx: This is the modal that any player will see when they choose the ‘Browse Games’ button in the town menu bar. This how Player 2 will join a game, as when they open this modal they will see a list of games that have been created by players in the town. Each listing will have the game type, the username of the player who created it, and a button to join the game. When a player clicks a join button, this will connect to the JoinGameModalDialog.
    - JoinGameModalDialog.tsx: This is the modal Player 2 will see after they confirm joining a game, and will be where their gameplay is. Depending on which game they join, they will either be taken to a TTL or Hangman game display and will be able to go through the game. Once the game is over the display switches to show a message saying which player won.
